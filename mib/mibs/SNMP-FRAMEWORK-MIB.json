In the latter case, the following\n                 example algorithm is recommended.\n\n                 In cases where there are multiple engines on the\n                 same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT\n                 appropriate, as it would result in all of those\n                 engines ending up with the same ID value.\n\n                 1) The very first bit is used to indicate how the\n                    rest of the data is composed.\n\n                    0 - as defined by enterprise using former methods\n                        that existed before SNMPv3.

Such\n                    methods must be designed so as to maximize the\n                    possibility that the value of this object will\n                    be unique in the agent's administrative domain.\n                    For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP\n                    entity, or the MAC address of one of the\n                    interfaces, with each address suitably padded\n                    with random octets.  If multiple methods are\n                    defined, then it is recommended that the first\n                    octet indicate the method being used and the\n                    remaining octets be a function of the method.\n\n                 3) The length of the octet string varies.\n\n                    The first four octets are set to the binary\n                    equivalent of the agent's SNMP management\n                    private enterprise number as assigned by the\n                    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n                    For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned\n                    { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would\n                    be assigned '000002b8'H.\n\n                    The very first bit is set to 1. For example, the\n                    above value for Acme Networks now changes to be\n                    '800002b8'H.\n\n                    The fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and\n                    following octets) are formatted. The values for\n                    the fifth octet are:\n\n                      0     - reserved, unused.\n\n                      1     - IPv4 address (4 octets)\n                              lowest non-special IP address\n\n                      2     - IPv6 address (16 octets)\n                              lowest non-special IP address\n\n                      3     - MAC address (6 octets)\n                              lowest IEEE MAC address, canonical\n                              order\n\n                      4     - Text, administratively assigned\n                              Maximum remaining length 27\n\n                      5     - Octets, administratively assigned\n                              Maximum remaining length 27\n\n                      6-127 - reserved, unused\n\n                    128-255 - as defined by the enterprise\n                              Maximum remaining length 27\n                "

It is believed that such a range\n                 will be sufficient.  In the unlikely event that\n                 the standards committee finds this number to be\n                 insufficient over time, an enterprise number\n                 can be allocated to obtain an additional 256\n                 possible values.\n\n                 Note that the most significant bit must be zero;\n                 hence, there are 23 bits allocated for various\n                 organizations to design and define non-standard\n                 messageProcessingModels.  This limits the ability\n                 to define new proprietary implementations of\n                 Message Processing Models to the first 8,388,608\n                 enterprises.\n\n                 It is worthwhile to note that, in its encoded\n                 form, the messageProcessingModel value will\n                 normally require only a single byte since, in\n                 practice, the leftmost bits will be zero for\n                 most messages and sign extension is suppressed\n                 by the encoding rules.\n\n                 As of this writing, there are several values of\n                 messageProcessingModel defined for use with SNMP.\n                 They are as follows:\n\n                     0  reserved for SNMPv1\n                     1  reserved for SNMPv2c\n                     2  reserved for SNMPv2u and SNMPv2*\n                     3  reserved for SNMPv3\n                "
